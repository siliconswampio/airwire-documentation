## Welcome to the EOSIO Developers Portal!

The *EOSIO Developers Portal* is an EOSIO documentation platform that hosts a rich array of technical product documentation resources created and curated for the EOSIO blockchain developers community. These resources empower developers from all technology backgrounds to build enterprise-grade, secure, and scalable blockchain applications using the open-source EOSIO software.

We recognize our community developers to be an important part of the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem. Using the open source development model, we have a shared mission of leveraging the power of open source technologies to further mature the EOSIO platform.

> *The advancement of blockchain is the result of passionate developers like you building platforms that will inject trust and security back into our institutional systems*

Are you a new entrant to the blockchain space? If yes, no worries, we have learning and onboarding content to help orient you to the EOSIO development environment and create your first basic smart contract. If you are a seasoned blockchain developer enthusiast, we offer you a variety of documentation assets from advanced development tutorials to API reference guides.

This portal supports your EOSIO learning and development journey through the following curated technical documentation resources:

* [**EOSIO Concepts**](../20_introduction-to-eosio): Learn the core concepts of the EOSIO platform
* [**EOSIO Protocols**](../60_protocol-guides): Gain a deeper understanding of the various protocols such as [Accounts and Permissions](../60_protocol-guides/40_accounts_and_permissions.md) implemented in the EOSIO platform
* [**EOSIO Getting Started**](../30_getting-started-guide): Orient yourself with the EOSIO development environment and basic smart contract development. Best suited for new developers onboarding the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem
* **API and SDK Reference**: Browse our API catalogue and discover what kinds of APIs we provide
Glossary: Browse through a curated list of EOSIO terminologies.

And more!

## EOSIO Docs is Open Source

The *EOSIO Developers Portal* generates documentation from source files hosted on Github, alongside the [EOSIO](https://github.com/EOSIO) codebase. All documentation assets on [*developers.eos.io*](https://developers.eos.io/) is open sourced and designed to allow community contributions. We leverage the power of open source to deliver trusted content to support your EOSIO onboarding and advanced development journey.

### A Bit of History

The Developer Relations team (responsible for authoring the EOSIO developer documentation) spearheaded an audacious endeavor on the EOSIO product documentation spectrum. Due to the inherently intricate nature of the EOSIO software platform, the Developer Relations team collaborates closely with the EOSIO engineering division to receive authoritative, firsthand knowledge and inputs from the creators of the platform. The Developer Relations team conducted a sweeping tech reconnaissance of the then docs-engineering collaboration framework and ideated an environment to foster productive collaboration with the internal engineering division and the external EOSIO developer community. We discarded the then-existing, proprietary CMS platform, and implemented a new developer docs toolchain, where you produce documentation in the same ecosystem as code, in close proximity with the developers - [*Docs-as-Code*](https://www.docslikecode.com/).

The Developer Relations team further executed a conscientious and concerted effort of designing and deploying the Developer Portal that generates developer documentation by parsing source files in GitHub. The result of this effort was a developer portal that allows internal and external community contributions to the documentation.

### Fun Fact

Heard about the [*Github Archive Program*](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)? The endeavor to preserve open source software for future generations in case of an extinction-level event? 

The *Github Archive Program* includes the [EOSIO Project](https://github.com/EOSIO) (which includes documentation commits) along with other open source projects like Linux, Android, nodeJS, GatsbyJS, Python, docker, Bitcoin, Postgres, and others. Therefore, the longevity of the EOSIO source code is guaranteed!
