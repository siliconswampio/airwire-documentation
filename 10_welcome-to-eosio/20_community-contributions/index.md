We appreciate your interest in contributing to the EOSIO platform! We always welcome contributions from our community to make our code and docs better. You can contribute to EOSIO in the following ways:

* [Contribute to EOSIO Developer Portal Docs](#contribute-to-eosio-developer-portal-docs)
* [Contribute to EOSIO Community and Code](#contribute-to-eosio-community-and-code)

## Contribute to EOSIO Developer Portal Docs

The EOSIO documentation is written in Markdown. You can either submit a Pull Request for quick edits or file a new docs issue. For Markdown syntax usage, see the [Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Quick Edits
Quick edits allow for faster reporting of minor content issues from typographical errors to omissions.

Most of the pages on the EOSIO developer portal provide an **Edit** link which redirects you to the source file on Github. If you don't see the **Edit** button on a given page, it means that specific page is not available to be changed.

**To suggest a quick edit:**

1. Go to the specific page where you have identified an editorial need and click the **Edit** icon at the upper right of the page.

2. Fork the repository to suggest changes. Click **Fork this repository**.

3. Make the suggested changes in the web editor using Markdown syntax. Click the **Preview changes** tab to see the preview of the content.
4. After suggesting your changes, scroll down to the bottom on the page. Enter a title and a description of the changes you made and click **Propose file change**.
5. Create a ***Pull Request*** by entering a title and a description. Click **Create pull request** to submit your suggestion to us.

### Developers Community Involvement

#### EOSIO Stack Exchange

#### EOSIO Developer Telegram
Instantly engage the EOSIO developer community over [EOSIO Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/EaEnSUPktgfoI-XPfMYtcQ) instant messenger. Get involved by sharing your expertise in EOSIO development discussions, sharing community tools and projects that can assist EOSIO developers, and more.

### Get Involved with EOSIO Code

EOSIO is a large open source project with over 500 repositories for its stack and core components. You can visit the repositories in the [EOSIO Organization](https://github.com/EOSIO) on Github and start contributing to the code base.

There are many ways you can contribute to EOSIO code. You can report an issue, submit a pull request, and review pull requests.

### Reporting an Issue
If you're about to raise an issue because you think you've found a problem with the stack, or you'd like to make a request for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reason, please read this first.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **be civil**. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. See our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).

#### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository and can be reported in the form of a new issue.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; look for closed issues in the
   current milestone or try to reproduce it
   using the latest `develop` branch.

A good bug report or a new issue shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment and relevant tests that demonstrate the failure.

#### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check the feature hasn't already been requested.
1. Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
1. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's leaders of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is likely to be common.
