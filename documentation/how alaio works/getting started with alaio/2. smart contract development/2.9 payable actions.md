# 2.9: Payable actions

## Goal

This tutorial illustrates how to write a smart contract that has payable actions. Payable actions are actions that require you to transfer some tokens to actions prior to use other functionality of the smart contract. Also, the ALAIO asset type is covered in this tutorial.

As for the logic of this smart contract, we're going to write a contract that accepts a particular token but will not allow the tokens to be withdrawn for a specific amount of time.

## The token to HODL

First create a standard C++ class called "hodl" that extends alaio::contract.

    #include <alaio/alaio.hpp>

    using namespace alaio;

    class [[alaio::contract("hodl")]] hodl : public alaio::contract{
        private:
        public:
    }

This contract needs to set up a few constraints:

* What symbol/token does this contract accept?
* When is the hodl over?

Let us now define these constraints as constants:

* `hodl_symbol`: the symbol of tokens this contract accepts. In this case, we use the "SYS" symbol.
* `the_party` constant sets the hodl to end on Tuesday, February 22, 2022 10:22:22 PM.

    #include <alaiolib/alaio.hpp>

    using namespace alaio;

    class [[alaio::contract("hodl")]] hodl : public alaio::contract {
        private:
            static const uint32_t the_party = 1645525342;
            const symbol hodl_symbol;
        public:

    }

Next, let's define a table to track the number of tokens the hodl contract has received.

    struct [[alaio::table]] balance
    {
        alaio::asset funds;
        uint64_t primary_key() const { return funds.symbol.raw(); }
    };

In this multiple index table declaration, a new type called `asset` is used. An `asset` is a type designed to represent a digital token asset. See more details in the [asset reference documentation]().

The `symbol` member of an asset instance will be used as the primary key. By calling the `raw()` function the `symbol` variable will be converted into an unsigned integer so it can be used as a primary key.

## Constructor

The constructor initializes the hodl_symbol as “SYS”, which is a token created in the [Deploy, Issue and Transfer Tokens]() section.

    public:
        using contract::contract;
        hodl(name receiver, name code, datastream<const char *> ds):contract(receiver, code, ds), hodl_symbol("SYS", 4){}

## Get current UTC time

In order to get time in UTC timezone throughout the code, create a function to easily access the current UTC time.

    uint32_t now() {
        return current_time_point().sec_since_epoch();
    }

Next, we'll write the actions of the contract.

## Deposit

To accept a transfer we need to have a deposit action.

    [[alaio::on_notify("alaio.token::transfer")]]
    void deposit(name hodler, name to, alaio::asset quantity, std::string memo)
    {
    if (to != get_self() || hodler == get_self())
    {
        print("These are not the droids you are looking for.");
        return;
    }

    check(now() < the_party, "You're way late");
    check(quantity.amount > 0, "When pigs fly");
    check(quantity.symbol == hodl_symbol, "These are not the droids you are looking for.");

    balance_table balance(get_self(), hodler.value);
    auto hodl_it = balance.find(hodl_symbol.raw());

    if (hodl_it != balance.end())
        balance.modify(hodl_it, get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
            row.funds += quantity;
        });
    else
        balance.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
            row.funds = quantity;
        });
    }

This action should not introduce many new concepts if you have followed this tutorial from the beginning.

Firstly, the action checks that the contract is not transferring to itself:

    if (to != get_self() || hodler == get_self()) {
        print("These are not the droids you are looking for.");
        return;
    }

The contract needs to do so because transferring to the contract account itself would create an invalid booking situation in which an account could have more tokens than the account has in the `alaio.token` contract.

Then this action checks a few other conditions:

* The time to withdraw has not already passed
* The incoming transfer has a valid amount of tokens
* The incoming transfer uses the token we specify in the constructor

<br>

    check(now() < the_party, "You're way late");
    check(quantity.amount > 0, "When pigs fly");
    check(quantity.symbol == hodl_symbol, "These are not the droids you are looking for.");

If all constraints are passed, the action updates the balances accordingly:

    balance_table balance(get_self(), hodler.value);
    auto hodl_it = balance.find(hodl_symbol.raw());

    if (hodl_it != balance.end())
        balance.modify(hodl_it, get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
            row.funds += quantity;
        });
    else
        balance.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
            row.funds = quantity;
        });

The important thing to note is the deposit function will actually be triggered by the alaio.token contract. To understand this behaviour we need to understand the on_notify attribute.

## The on_notify attribute

    [[alaio::on_notify("alaio.token::transfer")]]

The `on_notify` attribute is one of the alaio.CDT [attributes]() that annotates a smart contract action.

Annotating an action with an `on_notify` attribute ensures any incoming notification is forwarded to the annotated action if and only if the notification is dispatched from a specified contract and from a specified action.

In this case, the `on_notify` attribute ensures the incoming notification is forward to the deposit action only if the notification comes from the `alaio.token` contract and is from the `alaio.toke`n's `transfer` action.

This is also why we don't need to check if the hodler actually has the appropriate amount of tokens he or she claimed, as the `alaio.token` contract would have done this check prior to the transfer notification reaching the `hodl` `deposit` action.

## Party!

The party action will only allow withdrawals after the configured the_party time has elapsed. The party action has a similar construct as the deposit action with the following conditions:

* check the withdrawing account is the account which made the deposit initially
* find the locked balance
* transfer the token from the hodl contract to the account itself

    [[alaio::action]]
    void party(name hodler)
    {
        //Check the authority of hodler
        require_auth(hodler);

        //Check the current time has passed the the_party time
        check(now() > the_party, "Hold your horses");

        balance_table balance(get_self(), hodler.value);
        auto hodl_it = balance.find(hodl_symbol.raw());

        //Make sure the holder is in the table
        check(hodl_it != balance.end(), "You're not allowed to party");

        action{
            permission_level{get_self(), "active"_n},
            "alaio.token"_n,
            "transfer"_n,
            std::make_tuple(get_self(), hodler, hodl_it->funds, std::string("Party! Your hodl is free."))
        }.send();

        balance.erase(hodl_it);
    }

            [[alaio::on_notify("alaio.token::transfer")]]
            void deposit(name hodler, name to, alaio::asset quantity, std::string memo) {
            if (hodler == get_self() || to != get_self())
            {

            if (hodl_it != balance.end())
                balance.modify(hodl_it, get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
                row.funds += quantity;
                });
            else
                balance.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto &row) {
                row.funds = quantity;
                });
            }

            void party(name hodler)
            {

            }.send();

            balance.erase(hodl_it);
        }
    };

Great, let's deploy it.

## Test deposit

First, create an account and deploy to it:

    alacli create account alaio hodl YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
    alaio-cpp hodl.cpp -o hodl.wasm
    alacli set contract hodl ./ -p hodl@active

As mentioned in a previous tutorial, this contract needs an alaio.code permission:

    alacli set account permission hodl active --add-code

Next, create a testing account:

    alacli create account alaio han YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY

Let's transfer some SYS tokens issued in the previous section to `han`:

    alacli push action alaio.token transfer '[ "alice", "han", "100.0000 SYS", "Slecht geld verdrijft goed" ]' -p alice@active

Finally, transfer some SYS tokens to the `hodl` contract from `han`'s account.

    alacli transfer han hodl '0.0001 SYS' 'Hodl!' -p han@active

## Test withdraw

To test the withdrawal feature, the `the_party` variable needs to be updated. Update the `the_party` variable to a point in time in the past so the withdrawal functionality can be tested.

    CONTRACT hodl : public alaio::contract {
    private:
        // 9 June 2018 01:00:00
        static const uint32_t the_party = 1528549200;

Withdrawing the funds:

    alacli push action hodl party '["han"]' -p han@active

Should produce the following response:

    executed transaction: 62b1e6848c8c5e6458b9a0f7600e65574eaf60445be114d224adccc5a962a09a  104 bytes  383 us
