# 1.5: Start kalad and alanode

## Step 1: Boot Node and Wallet

### Step 1.1: Start kalad

First let us start kalad:

    kalad &

You should see some output that looks like this:

    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.789 thread-0  wallet_plugin.cpp:42          plugin_initialize    ] initializing wallet plugin
    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.795 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/kalad/stop
    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  wallet_api_plugin.cpp:73      plugin_startup       ] starting wallet_api_plugin
    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/create
    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/create_key
    info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/get_public_keys

Press enter to continue

### Troubleshooting

After entering `kalad &`, you may encounter this message:

    "3120000 wallet_exception: Wallet exception Failed to lock access to wallet directory; is another kalad running?"

This is because another instance of `kalad` process might be running in the background. Kill all instances by `pkill kalad` and rerun `kalad &`.

### Step 1.2: Start alanode

Start alanode now:

    alanode -e -p alaio \
    --plugin alaio::producer_plugin \
    --plugin alaio::producer_api_plugin \
    --plugin alaio::chain_api_plugin \
    --plugin alaio::http_plugin \
    --plugin alaio::history_plugin \
    --plugin alaio::history_api_plugin \
    --filter-on="*" \
    --access-control-allow-origin='*' \
    --contracts-console \
    --http-validate-host=false \
    --verbose-http-errors >> alanode.log 2>&1 &

These settings accomplish the following:

1. Run **Nodala**. This command loads all the basic plugins, set the server address, enable CORS and add some contract debugging and logging.
2. Enable CORS with no restrictions (*) and development logging

> In the above configuration, CORS is enabled for `*` for development purposes only, you should never enable CORS for `*` on a node that is publicly accessible!

### Troubleshooting

After starting alanode, if you see an error message similar to "Database dirty flag set (likely due to unclean shutdown): replay required", try to start alanode with --replay-blockchain. More details on troubleshooting alanode can be found here.

## Step 2: Check the installation

### Step 2.1: Check that Nodala is Producing Blocks

Run the following command

    tail -f alanode.log

You should see some output in the console that looks like this:

Press `ctrl + c` to close the log

### Step 2.2: Check the Wallet

Open the shell and run the alacli command to list available wallets. We will talk more about wallets in the future. For now, we need to validate the installation and see that the command line client alacli is working as intended.

    alacli wallet list

You should see a response with an empty list of wallets:

    Wallets:
    []

From this point forward, you'll be executing commands from your local system (Linux or Mac)

### Step 2.3: Check Nodala endpoints

This will check that the RPC API is working correctly, pick one.

1. Check the get_info endpoint provided by the chain_api_plugin in your browser: http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_info
2. Check the same thing, but in the console on your host machine

    curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_info
