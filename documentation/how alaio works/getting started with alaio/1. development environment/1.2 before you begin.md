# 1.2: Before You Begin

## Step 1: Install binaries

To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors.

> You can find how to build ALAIO from source [here](link_to_docs)

The below commands will download binaries for respective operating systems.

### Mac OS X Brew Install:

    brew tap alaio/alaio
    brew install alaio

> If you don't have Brew installed, follow the installation instructions on the [official Brew website](https://brew.sh/).

### Ubuntu 18.04 Debian Package Install:

    wget https://github.com/ALADINIO/ala/releases/download/v2.0.0/alaio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb
    sudo apt install ./alaio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb

### Ubuntu 16.04 Debian Package Install:

    wget https://github.com/ALADINIO/ala/releases/download/v2.0.0/alaio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-16.04_amd64.deb
    sudo apt install ./alaio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-16.04_amd64.deb

### CentOS RPM Package Install:

    wget https://github.com/ALADINIO/ala/releases/download/v2.0.0/alaio-2.0.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
    sudo yum install ./alaio-2.0.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

> If you have previous versions of alaio installed on your system, please uninstall before proceeding. For detailed instructions, see [here]().

## Step 2: Setup a development directory, stick to it.

You're going to need to pick a directory to work from, it's suggested to create a contracts directory somewhere on your local drive.

    mkdir contracts
    cd contracts
