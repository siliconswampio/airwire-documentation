# Motivation

## Facts:

### All Existing Blockchains fail to deal with “The Hardware Problem”

All existing blockchains involve some form of centralization at the hardware level and avoid dealing with the issues that exist at the hardware level. Networks historically push this issue off to the block producers or miners to deal with and do not address it beyond that. For example, the Ethereum mainnet is primarily powered by devices manufactured by two companies, AMD and Nvidia. These companies do not release firmware as open-source code effectively preventing end-users from stopping Specter-style attacks that could take place to destabilize a large amount of the systems that power key mechanisms of trust in these networks.

### Support Millions of Users

Blockchain Technology is capable of handling tens of millions of active daily users. In certain cases, an application may not work unless a critical mass of users is reached. Therefore a platform that can handle very large numbers of users is paramount.


### Free Usage

App developers need the flexibility to offer users free services; users should not have to pay to use the platform or benefit from its services. A blockchain platform that supports feeless use for players will likely gain more widespread adoption. Developers and Game Studios can then create effective monetization strategies and a better user experience (UX) for mass adoption. AirWire has no gas fees at all so you can mint your NFTs for no cost.

### Low Latency

A good user experience in multiplayer gaming demands reliable feedback with a delay of no more than a few hundred milliseconds. Longer delays frustrate users and make games built on a blockchain less competitive with existing non-blockchain alternatives. 


### Interoperability

Abstracted Ownership for digital assets across all platforms: Easily trade or gift your NFTs to your friends at no cost. Game Studios building blockchain-based applications need the flexibility to enhance their applications with the latest features on the best protocol available without being tied down to a specific tech stack. The platform must support workflows based on open-source protocols and integrations to any technology needed for dApp development. Interoperability allows you to store the NFT with AirWire or take it onto the chain of your choosing. AirWire allows you to store your public photos inside your profile and secure personal media with private, decentralized storage
