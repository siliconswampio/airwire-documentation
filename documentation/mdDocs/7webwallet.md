# AirWire Web Wallet

## Wallet Apps

Wallet apps are similar to physical wallets, in that they let you store different forms of currency such as money, credit cards, and cryptocurrency. Blockchain wallets allow you to store, manage and use various forms of cryptocurrencies, as-well-as other blockchain-based digital assets. There are two basic types of blockchain wallets: software wallets and hardware wallets. Blockchain wallets are usually stored in apps on mobile and other internet-based electronics. A hardware wallet is a physical device that secures access to your cryptos offline. They are easy to use and have become more and more popular with the mass adoption of digital currencies. Wallet apps have increased in popularity with the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies as an investment asset class, digital payments option, and digital economy facilitator. 


## Metamask

Metamask is a cryptocurrency “soft” wallet app that can be downloaded on any software device to store and function with crypto on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can access their wallets through a web browser or download the mobile app. This then can be used for interaction with decentralized applications. The installation and account creation is fast and simple to use. Once you import your Ethereum onto a MetaMask wallet, you can send or receive Ethers directly from your MetaMask wallet. It is secure compared to live wallets since it encrypts information with encryption algorithms. This makes it secure compared to live wallets. You can buy and sell NFTs with ease on MetaMask since it connects them with multiple NFT markets. MetaMask enables you to register and play games on major crypto networks such as Ethereum.     

## Anchor

Anchor is a next-generation authenticator powered by blockchain technology. It is an open-sourced digital wallet with a focus on security and privacy on the EOSIO-based network. 
It is available on mobile or desktop. Anchor has allowed for the utilization of the decentralized power of blockchains to people with less tech-savvy knowledge. This allows for the adoption of blockchain capabilities to a greater number of the public. Anchor enables login, signing the documentation, and executing distributed smart contracts conveniently with the ease that you would receive from a centralized solution. Your private EOS key can be imported into your Anchor wallet to enable seamless connection to multiple services of the EOSIO ecosystem. 

## Scatter

Scatter wallets are used to safely manage keys and sign transactions. Scatter allows blockchain-centric applications from users without exposing their private keys. Scatter wallets are considered the least secure since it is mainly browser-based wallet that often sends your private key to the company server. Scatter was a chrome extension that used a single sign-on with asymmetric encryption to avoid security issues. This allows you to sign transactions without exposing your private key. Scatter stores everything on your device, so any data sent to the blockchain is sent as a hashed fingerprint. Scatter has a mobile version in production and currently supports EOS and Ethereum, with support for more blockchains continuously being added.

## MegaMask

AirWire has established a solution for the multi-chain processing of smart contracts with MegaMask. MegaMask was created to send and/or receive funds from one blockchain to a separate chain, for a cross-chain swap amongst different networks. It is a downloadable extension for interoperable transactions across multiple blockchains. These transactions can then be carried out without the need of previously having or creating an account on each chain for the transaction to be accepted. Safety and security are a priority with MegaMask as a deterministic system, with the ability to sign and verify contracts, cross-platform on each end. In this, an account is automatically created on both sides of the contract between networks for the exchange to carry out, without the need for a wallet in place on both ends. Instead, a public address is automatically assigned for the process to be carried out multi-chain between the sender and receiver.
