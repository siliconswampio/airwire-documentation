# Economics

## Wire Token 

Wire token is the fundamental native asset of the Wire ecosystem, and its functionality is enabled for all accounts. Each token is a unique digital asset like Ether which can be used to:

    - Pay the system for processing transactions and storing data.
    - Run a validating node as part of the network by participating in the staking process.
    - Help determine how network resources are allocated and where its future technical direction will go by participating in governance processes.

The Wire token enables the economic coordination of all participants who operate the network plus it enables new behaviors among the applications which are built on top of that network.

The ecosystem which makes up the Wire platform is driven primarily by economic forces. This economy creates incentives that allow participants without permission to organize and drive the platform’s key functions while creating strong disincentives for undesirable, irresponsible, or malicious behavior. For the platform to be effective, these incentives need to exist both in the short term and the long term.

Fundamentally, the Wire platform is a marketplace between willing participants.  On the supply side, operators of the validator nodes and other fundamental infrastructure need to be incentivized to provide these services which make up the “community cloud.”  On the demand side, the developers and end-users of the platform who are paying for its use need to be able to do so in a way that is simple, clear, and consistent so it helps them.

Further, economic forces can also be applied to support the ecosystem as a whole.  They can be used at a micro level to create new business models by directly compensating the developers who create its most useful applications. They can also be used at a macro level by coordinating the efforts of a broader set of ecosystem participants who participate in everything from education to governance.

## ERC-20 Interoperability

A second phase of the relaunch is utilizing the AirWire platform to swap users of the WIRE token away from the previous PIVX blockchain into a new ERC20 WIRE token. The new ERC20 WIRE token will be issued in a reverse token split of 10:1. The WIRE token will maintain some of its previous utility inside the platform, while new concepts will be added to its staking and reward features.

All former users and account holders are now able to access their accounts and wallets on the platform. In the first half of 2021, AirWire will conduct a swap for the classic WIRE tokens to facilitate a migration to its new blockchain protocol, currently under redevelopment, migrating from the original PIVX blockchain.

## Sustainability

The platform should encourage significant decentralization both in the short-term and the long-term, to properly secure the value it hosts. The platform — and community — should be widely inclusive and without the need for permission, while actively encouraging decentralization and participation. To maintain sustainability, both technological and community governance mechanisms should allow for practical iteration while avoiding capture by any single party in the long run.
