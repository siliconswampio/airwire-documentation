## Wire Name Service and UPAP

The Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (or UPAP) is an open-source standard that facilitates seamless and trustless transactions across different blockchain networks by deploying name service smart contracts on each network. This technology negates the need for bridges and oracles, which are both prone to exploits. For Wire, we are deploying Wire Name Service (WNS) on a few of the most popular networks.

WNS employs name service smart contracts, akin to decentralized domain registrars, which are deployed on each participating layer-1 blockchain network. These smart contracts can be conceptualized as universal escrow buckets that hold assets and enable a novel form of abstracted ownership. In essence, all the assets deposited within these smart contracts are owned by the users, yet they can span multiple networks without users needing native accounts or encountering the associated transaction costs on those networks.

One key advantage of WNS is the ability to leverage domain names (e.g., joseph.eth) or sub-domains (e.g., alice.wire.eth), as well as typical native addresses (e.g., public Ethereum addresses starting with 0xâ€¦) to facilitate transactions. This flexibility makes WNS a versatile solution, particularly when integrated with name services such as Wire Name Service (WNS).

Let us consider the Wire blockchain network, Ethereum, and Solana in conjunction with WNS to illustrate UPAP's capabilities. When a WNS smart contract is deployed on each of these three separate layer-1 blockchains (L1s), where each contract acts as a storage and transaction facilitator for the respective blockchain's assets. These contracts communicate with both the Wire settlement layer and native L1s to transact with assets both within and outside the WNS system.

**Use Case 1: Atomic Swap Across Blockchains**

Suppose Bob possesses $100 of ETH on Ethereum and Alice has $100 of SOL on Solana, both stored in their respective UPAP-enabled wallets. If they wish to swap these assets, the WNS system can perform an atomic swap on the Wire blockchain, which acts as the settlement layer. Either party can initiate this transaction using their UPAP-enabled wallet. For instance, Bob proposes a transaction to exchange his $100 in ETH for Alice's $100 in SOL. Alice then finalizes the transaction in her UPAP-enabled wallet, resulting in the updated ownership being confirmed and reflected in the WNS system.

**Use Case 2: Cross-chain Payments**

Let's add complexity. Suppose Bob owes Alice $100 for dinner and has $100 of USDC in Ethereum's WNS smart contract. If Alice possesses a UPAP-enabled wallet or a Wire username, Bob can simply send his USDC to Alice, with the transaction being settled on the Wire blockchain. But, if Alice only has a Solana wallet with a traditional Solana address, Bob can withdraw his USDC directly to Alice on Solana using his UPAP-enabled wallet, sending to her directly. This versatility highlights the protocol's capability to perform cross-chain transactions seamlessly.

UPAP's essence lies in the principle of "abstracted ownership," where assets can be held and transacted across multiple blockchain networks without the need for native accounts or incurring network-specific fees. This not only enables seamless cross-chain transactions but also opens up many new opportunities for users to engage with digital assets, such as buying an Ethereum NFT on a network like Wire without any Ethereum gas fees.
