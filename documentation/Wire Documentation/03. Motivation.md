# Motivation

## Facts:

### All Existing Blockchains fail to deal with 'The Hardware Problem'

All existing blockchains involve some form of centralization at the hardware level and avoid dealing with the issues that exist at the hardware level. Historically, networks push this issue off to the block producers or miners to deal with and do not address it beyond that. For example, the Ethereum mainnet is primarily powered by devices manufactured by two companies, AMD and Nvidia. These companies do not release firmware as open-source code effectively, preventing end-users from stopping Specter-style attacks that could take place, destabilizing a large amount of the systems that power key mechanisms of trust in these networks.

### Support Millions of Users

In certain cases, an application may not work unless a critical mass of users is reached. Therefore, a platform that can handle very large numbers of users is paramount. Wire's Blockchain technology is capable of handling tens of millions of active users daily.

### Free Usage

App developers need the flexibility to offer users free services. Users should not have to pay to use the platform or benefit from its services. A blockchain platform that supports feeless use for players will likely gain more widespread adoption. Developers and Game Studios can then create effective monetization strategies and a better user experience (UX) for mass adoption. Wire has no gas fees at all so you can mint your NFTs for no cost.

### Low Latency

A good user experience in multiplayer gaming demands reliable feedback with a delay of no more than a few hundred milliseconds. Longer delays frustrate users and make games built on a blockchain less competitive with existing non-blockchain alternatives. Wire offers very low latency to solve this problem, offering users the experience that they need on blockchain games.

### Interoperability

Wire's interoperability allows abstracted ownership for digital assets across all platforms. Easily trade or gift NFTs to your friends at o cost. Game Studios building blockchain-based applications need the flexibility to enhance their applications with the latest features on the best protocol available, without being tied down to a specific tech stack. The platform must support workflows based on open-source protocols with integrations to any technology needed for dApp development. Interoperability allows you to  store the NFT with the Wire Wallet or take it onto the chain of your choice. Wire allows you to store your public photos inside your profile and secure personal media with private, decentralized storage.
