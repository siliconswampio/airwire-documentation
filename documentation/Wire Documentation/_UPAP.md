# Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol
UPAP is a wallet protocol that handles generation of a new universal key standard and allows for any block chain network’s protocols to extend UPAP's Universal Keys through the use of a standardized extension module.

Network Modules have been built out for current leading blockchain technologies such as;

* EOS
    * Wire
    * EOSIO Mainnet
    * Wax
* EVM
    * Ethereum
    * Polygon
* Bitcoin

Legacy blockchain keys can be imported and converted to UPAP's Universal Key standard with the use of any network’s extension module.
