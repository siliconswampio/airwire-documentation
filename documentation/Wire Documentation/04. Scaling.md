# Scaling and Network Expansion

The Wire Network is designed to tackle the challenges associated with scalability, a critical issue in both centralized and decentralized systems of today. It leverages a unique approach to maintain an efficient platform that scales based on network usage, allowing the network to support enterprise-grade, globally-used applications with no upper limit.

## Scalability

Wire Network scales using parallelization and innovative parachain structures functioning as independent blockchains but tethered to the central relay chain, enabling concurrent transactions processing, effectively sidestepping the traditional bottleneck of sequential transaction validation prevalent in earlier generation blockchains. Inherent to this design is the implementation of Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT), which confers upon Wire Network an ability to sustain network consensus without compromising on the speed and efficiency of communication. By assigning users to different instances and time slots, the transaction load is evenly distributed across the network. This reduces the risk of any single instance becoming a bottleneck. Additionally, the system can be scaled up by adding more EOSIO instances and adjusting the user schedule accordingly.

## Network Expansion Events

When a certain threshold is reached, a node sale is triggered and parachains will be spawned only once the last node is sold. This design choice ensures a tight coupling between network expansion and resource demand, thereby preserving the network's efficiency and equilibrium. The deployment of new parachains upon this event is an essential mechanism that aids in maintaining the network's high throughput and responsiveness, while concurrently ensuring seamless onboarding of new nodes, without compromising the network's overarching asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance.
