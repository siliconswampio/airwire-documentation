# Wire Ecosystem 

## Immutable Communities
 
Immutability is a feature of the Wire Network that is very important. It makes the inability of a block to be deleted or modified once it is in the blockchain. Immutability is a blockchain feature that persists data forever, free from censorship despite the disincentives to do so for some period. Before blockchain, immutability existed only in closed systems through the benevolence of a custodian. Blockchain now allows for the immutability we have needed for a long time, maintaining unaltered data without censorship.

## Consensus

Wire utilizes an Appointed Proof of Stake model (APoS) where T1 Node Operators must be appointed and recognized by existing T1 Node Operators to make decisions. Under this algorithm, T1's may select block producers through a continuous approval system of appointment. Each block gets produced at 500 m/s, while only one producer has the authorization to create a block at any given point in time. If the block production fails to meet the time scheduled, it gets skipped for that time slot. When one or more blocks get passed by, a 0.5-second gap or more occurs in the blockchain. Wire blocks get produced in rounds of 126 (6 blocks each, times 21 producers.)
 
There are two main consensus models in which blockchains form, Proof of Work(PoW) and Proof of Stake(PoS). In a PoW model, the miner's nodes compete to find a nonce added to the header of the block produced. The nonce will cause it to have the desired property that is needed. It is computationally expensive to find such nonces that make the blocks valid. It also becomes difficult for attacks using an alternative blockchain fork to be accepted by the rest of the network as the best chain. The drawbacks of utilizing a PoW are slow transaction speeds causing expensive fees with high energy usage.

The other model widely used and accepted is known as the PoS model. In this model, nodes owning the most stake/percentage of the asset have equivalent decision power. As a result, voting rights become proportionate to the stakeholders. A variant of this model is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), in which many participants or stakeholders elect a smaller number of delegates who make decisions for them. Although energy-efficient, validators with more holdings potentially can have excessive influence on transaction verification.

PoS is not as proven in terms of security as PoW and often is criticized for its vulnerability to centralization. Blockchains such as EOSIO have attempted to mend the PoS model through a DPoS model where owning higher numbers of Nodes can use their stake as a voting method. These votes select a small group to make decisions on behalf of the community. Even in a DPoS Model, the blockchain's governance structure is subject to manipulation if enough votes get cast from a centralized majority. Wire utilizes an APoS combined with Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance for optimal consensus.

Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance, commonly known as ABFT, is a complicated but well-liked and trusted method for layer-one consensus. Essentially, the layer utilizes a two-stage block confirmation mechanism. This mechanism entails using a 2/3 plus 1 protocol in which the supermajority of Node operators from the currently scheduled set confirms each block twice. This layer also is utilized to signal producer schedule changes at the beginning of each schedule round. 

Wire's APoS model has improved upon its predecessors, with Proof of Authority (PoA) and DPoS. In a PoA model, the consensus mechanism is based on identity and is a practical, efficient solution for private blockchain networks. In essence, this model stakes your "reputation" rather than coins. The drawback of this model is that it is more centralized, leaving it vulnerable to censorship and manipulation. A similar problem to DPoS gets caused since many votes cast by a single centralized authority could potentially manipulate the decision-making process of the Node Operators.

APoS has been able to make improvements to the previous model's design. In an APoS model, Node seats get appointed among Operators proven to have great insight and value of the Governance of the Wire Blockchain. The only way for new T1 and T2 Node Seats to be added would be through the election of a supermajority of current Node seat votes in a 2/3 plus 1 mechanism. That would prevent exterior influence on the Node Operators and allow them to become viewed in public.

## Roll Up Technology

Wire's blockchain introduces the concept of "likely irreversible transactions" that will help games requiring faster frames per second (fps) to take place. The roll-up moves batches of transactions to Layer-2, creating a validity proof of all the transactions moved. Then the proofs are submitted to Layer-1 to serve as a proxy for their corresponding bundles. This technology allows for reduced data, resulting in lower time and gas costs for validating a block. The drawback of such technology is that they are not suited for general-purpose applications. The technology is not a problem with minor data transactions such as player movement and other non-core aspects of fast competitive gameplay; however, if a faulty play from a participant is likely, actions can be taken immediately, resulting in their loss.
