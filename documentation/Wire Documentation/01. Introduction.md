## Abstract

Wire Network is an innovative blockchain platform designed to enable trustless cross-chain transactions, overcoming current scalability and interoperability challenges. Wire Network uses a novel Appointed Proof of Stake (APoS) model, an evolution beyond Delegated Proof of Stake. It further incorporates the [Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol](https://upap.io/) (UPAP), which when paired with name service smart contracts on each layer-1 blockchain can enhance interoperability across different blockchains akin to how HTTP standardized internet communication. Wire Network represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, offering partition-resistant networking, serverless computing, and distributed storage within a trustless computing environment. The platform is completely open-source and trustless, all the way down to the hardware, paving the way for secure decentralized applications and fostering blockchain technology adoption at scale.

## Usability and Adoption

The Wire Network is dedicated to enhancing the user experience, significantly simplifying the process for non-technical users to engage with and deploy decentralized applications. To achieve this, we've integrated single sign-on login options, in addition to social sign-ons, thus creating a familiar and effortless entry point for users.

We have implemented a system that allows users to sign up and log in using conventional means: a username, password, and a phone number or email. These elements, widely used in mainstream applications, are now available within the decentralized framework, increasing accessibility and ease of use. A sample sign-up and login experience can be seen on our flagship NFT marketplace: [R4R3](https://www.r4r3.io/).

Furthermore, we understand the inevitable occurrence of users forgetting passwords. Consequently, we've developed a feature for password resets within our trustless decentralized framework, hence ensuring users are never locked out of their accounts due to forgetfulness. This feature is a significant step towards user empowerment in terms of self-custody within a blockchain environment, making Wire Network an accessible platform for wider adoption of decentralized applications and blockchain technology.

## The Objective

The chief objective of Wire Network is to decisively confront and overcome the Blockchain Trilemma, ensuring a harmonious fusion of decentralization, security, and scalability. However, our ambition extends beyond this: we are committed to enabling seamless interoperability among all blockchain networks. Recognizing the vulnerabilities of current solutions such as oracles and bridges, which are susceptible to attacks, we seek to create a platform that fosters a more secure, resilient connection between different blockchains. Our goal is to deliver a robust network that not only addresses the Trilemma but also safeguards the trustless, interconnected ecosystem of blockchains and allows for the mass adoption of blockchain technology.
