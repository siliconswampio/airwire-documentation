Governance
==========
Governance in the blockchain gets based on a set of rules of consensus among the users participating in the blockchain, with one form occurring within the blockchain(on-chain) and the other operating outside the blockchain(off-chain.) Through governance, rules are agreed upon and followed to achieve good system development. NFTs added a principle designed to give player's option to vote on changes within the game development. Developers launched governance NFTs within the game sector in 2020. Players can use their NFTs as a voice now, giving the players the right to vote on future developments and gameplay elements. Every NFT owned by the player counts as one vote on the developmental aspects in the game sector. The more NFTs collected and kept allow for more voting rights.


Structure
---------

Wire nodes T1, T2, & T3 will be available to purchase in USD, BTC, ETH, or Stable Coin via a private sale. Wire node purchasers receive rewards in $WIRE tokens equal to the amount of USD used to purchase the node at the $WIRE token price. Nodes are a point in a network that either distributes data to other nodes in the network or is an endpoint of a network. Typical blockchain nodes may interconnect to several other nodes in a network. Three different tiers of nodes are available for purchase as the network launches.

Now available, we have 10 of the 21 appointed T1 nodes that are the most scarce, and you can purchase them for the cost of 750,000 USD for each node. We have 76 of the 80 appointed T2 nodes available to buy for 100,000 USD per node. We also have 1,000 appointed T3 nodes available for purchase for 10,000 USD for each node. The current model involves the WIRE allocation for nodes of three tiers that can stake to get rewarded back for a percentage of the inventory. New nodes will be released in the inventory expansion when the games utilizing the resources of T1 and T2 use up our current existing inventory.

Staking
-----

Staking is more decentralized, allowing for increased participation and more secure sharding. It makes it easier for you to run a node. It doesn't require huge investments in hardware or energy, and if you don't have enough ETH to stake, you can join staking pools in our marketplace.

Staking a node helps with security and can help prevent "Bad Actors." Bad Actors are scam artists and hackers that attempt to attack the network with invalid transactions placed into a block. A big issue facing digital currency is its lack of proof that users haven't spent the same money twice.

Assuming there is a miner that will put invalid transactions into a block. First, this miner has to find a very high-difficulty hash to make the block valid. Second, if the miner can find a hash and successfully publish this corrupted/invalid block, any node that receives this invalid block will examine the data and recognizes that it is not valid. Node seats get appointed among Operators seen as having great insight and value of the Governance of the Wire blockchain.

General Assembly Tier 1
-----------------------

-  Appointed Artificial Governance Seats Tier 1: Founder Node Owners - T1 Wire Nodes each stake 7.5m WIRE rewarded back over 12 months and hold an equal share of 4% of existing inventory.Â 

-  Primaries - The Founder's Node Owners will get White-listed for future nodes in the Wire Node Expansion.

-  Main Task - Maintaining the consensus between other nodes and verifying transactions.

-  21 Seats - 10 of the 21 appointed T1 nodes sold to start as the network launches.

Interface Tier 2
----------------

-  Councilor Seats - T2 Wire Nodes each stake 1m WIRE rewarded back over 24 months, each holds an equal share of 0.15% of existing inventory.

-  80 Seats - Available with 76 of the 80 appointed T2 nodes for purchase at first.

-  Tier 2 - Depends on the consensus rules enforced and requires at least one full archival node to operate.

-  T1 and T2 - Can White-List contracts with your $PWR and $INV.

Social Governance
-----------------

- Proprietors Citizenship Tier 3:

- 1,000 appointed T3 nodes will be available to purchase to start.

- 450 to 1450 Seats

- Citizenship Tier 4:

- Gen 1 Seats minted until Network expansion 

- Account's purchase names give them complete control of their keys
