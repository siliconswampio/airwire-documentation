Governance
==========
Governance in the blockchain is based on a set of rules by consensus among the users participating in the blockchain.  In the blockchain, two types of governance can be identified. One occurs within the blockchain (on-chain) and the other operates outside the blockchain(off-chain.) Through governance, certain general rules are agreed upon to be followed to achieve a good development of the system.  NFTs added a principle that was designed to give the player the ability to vote on changes in the development. The developers launched Governance NFTs within the game sector in 2020. Players can use their NFTs as a voice now, which gives players the right to vote on future developments and gameplay elements. Every NFT owned by the player counts as one vote on the developmental aspects in the game sector. The more NFTs collected and owned allows for more voting rights.


Structure
---------

Wire Nodes T1, T2, & T3 will be available to purchase in USD, BTC, ETH, or Stable Coin via a private sale. Wire Node purchasers will be rewarded in $WIRE token equal to the amount of USD they used to purchase the Wire node with a $WIRE token price. A node is a point in a network that either distributes data to other nodes in the network or is an endpoint of a network. A typical blockchain node may be interconnected to several other nodes in a network. There are three different tiers of Wire nodes that are available for purchase as the network launches.

Available now, 10 of the 21 appointed T1 nodes being the most scarce can be purchased for the cost of $750,000 USD per node. 76 of the 80 appointed T2 nodes will be available to purchase at $100,000 USD per node. 1,000 appointed T3 nodes will be available to purchase for $10,000 USD per node. The current model involves the WIRE allocation for Wire Nodes for 3 different tiers that can be staked to be rewarded back for a percentage of inventory. New Wire Nodes will be released in the Inventory Expansion when the games utilizing the resources of T1 and T2 use up the current existing inventory.

Staking
-----

Staking is more decentralized, it allows for increased participation and more secure sharding. It makes it easier for you to run a node. It doesn't require huge investments in hardware or energy, and if you don't have enough ETH to stake, you can join staking pools.

Staking a Node helps with security and can help prevent, "Bad Actors." Bad Actors are scam artists and hackers that attempt to attack the network with invalid transactions placed into a block. A big issue facing digital currency is its lack of proof that users haven't spent the same money twice.

Assuming there is a miner that will put invalid transactions into a block: First, this miner has to find a very high-difficulty hash to make the block valid. Secondly, if the miner can find a hash, and successfully publish this corrupted/invalid block, any node that receives this invalid block will examine the data and recognize it as invalid.

A node is a point in a network that either distributes data to other nodes in the network or is an endpoint of a network. A typical blockchain node may be interconnected to several other nodes in a network. Node Seats are appointed among Operators seen to have great insight and value of the Governance of the Wire Blockchain. New Wire Nodes will be released in the Inventory Expansion when the games utilizing the resources of T1 and T2 use up the current existing inventory.

General Assembly Tier 1
-----------------------

-  Appointed Artificial Governance Seats Tier 1: 

-Founder Node Owners -T1 Wire Nodes would each stake 7.5m WIRE to be rewarded back over 12 months and each holds an equal share of 4% of existing inventory.

-Primaries - The Founder's Node Owners will be whitelisted for future nodes in the Wire Node Expansion.

-Main Tasks - Include maintaining the consensus between other nodes and verification of transactions.

-21 Seats - 10 of the 21 appointed T1 nodes will be sold to start as the network launches.

Interface Tier 2
----------------

-Councilor Seats - T2 Wire Nodes would each stake 1m WIRE to be rewarded back over 24 months and each holds an equal share of 0.15% of existing inventory.

-80 Seats - Available with 76 of the 80 appointed T2 nodes will be available to purchase to start.

-Tier 2 - Depend on the consensus rules being enforced and require at least one full archival node to operate.

-T1 and T2 - Can whitelist contracts with your $PWR and $INV.

Social Governance
-----------------

-Proprietors Citizenship Tier 3:

-1,000 appointed T3 nodes will be available to purchase to start. 

-T3 Wire Nodes would stake 100,000 WIRE to be rewarded back over 36 months and  each holds an equal share  of 0.00045% of existing inventory. 

-450 to 1450 Seats

-Citizenship Tier 4:

-Gen 1 Seats minted until Network expansion 

-Accounts purchase names giving them full control of their keys

-Vagrants Tier 5:

-Temporary accounts until upgrading to Tier 4
