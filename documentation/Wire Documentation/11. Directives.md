# Directives

Wire provides community-operated cloud infrastructure for deploying and running decentralized applications. It combines the features of a decentralized database with others of a serverless computing platform. The token allows this platform to run while enabling the applications built on it to interact with each other in new ways. Together, these features help the development team create censorship-resistant back-ends for applications dealing with high-stakes data like money, identity, assets and open-state components, all interacting seamlessly. The application back-ends and components are "smart contracts," though we will often refer to these all as simply "applications" here.

The infrastructure that makes up this cloud got created from a potentially infinite number of "nodes" run by individuals and organizations worldwide. They offer portions of their CPU and hard drive space on their laptops or professionally deployed servers. Developers write smart contracts and deploy them to this cloud as if they were deploying to a single server, which is a process very similar to how applications deploy to existing centralized clouds. 

Once the developer has deployed an application, called a "smart contract," and marked it unchangeable ("immutable,") the application will now run for as long as at least a handful of members of the Wire community continue to exist. End users interacting with that deployed application will generally do so through a familiar web or mobile interface like any one of a million apps today.

In a centralized cloud hosted by Amazon or Google, developers pay for their applications monthly based on their requirements. For example, it can become based on the number of requests generated by users visiting their webpages. The Wire platform similarly requires that either users or developers provide compensation for their usage to the community operators of this infrastructure. Like today's cloud infrastructure, Wire's price usage gets based on easy-to-understand metrics that aren't influenced heavily by factors such as system congestion. Such factors make it very complicated for developers on alternative blockchain-based systems running today.

## Proposed Instruction Sets

Proposed instruction sets are the complete set of all the instructions in machine code that can be recognized and executed by a central processing unit. Instruction set architecture (ISA) is the basic set of operations a computer or device must support for a functional definition of operations, with precise descriptions of how to invoke and access them. On your device, each instruction becomes represented by a sequence of bits. The instruction gets divided into fields corresponding to the constituent elements of the instruction. During instruction execution, an instruction is read into an instruction register (IR) in the CPU. The CPU must be able to extract the data from the various instruction fields to perform the required operation.

## WIPs

Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs) describe standards for the Wire Network. It may include core protocol specifications, client application programming interface and contract standards. WIPs consist of a designed document that provides updated information to the community or can describe a new feature within the Wire environment. Wire Improvement Proposals consist of technical specifications, the rationale for the proposal, consensus built within the community and documentation of opinions within the ecosystem. Improvement proposals are a crucial mechanism for documenting decisions. They provide a collection of community input and propose new features.
