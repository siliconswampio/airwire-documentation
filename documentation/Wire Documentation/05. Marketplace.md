## NFT Camera

AirWire's NFT Camera allows you to capture and secure your most precious moments straight to your phone by downloading this first of its kind App. Profile pictures, private moments, and personal identification, all have a safe place in AirWire's decentralized NFT media storage. You can enhance your photos with editing tools and premium filters before you mint the photo into an NFT, all from your phone or chosen device. Interoperability allows you to store the NFT with AirWire or take it onto the chain of your choice. You can store your public photos inside your AirWire profile or secure your media in your private, decentralized storage. Monetize your valuable NFT photos in AirWire's NFT Marketplace, while getting paid royalty fees each time it sells for the lifetime of the NFT.
