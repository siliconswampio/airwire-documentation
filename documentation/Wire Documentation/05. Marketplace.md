# R4R3.io NFT Marketplace
 
Wire has an easy-to-access marketplace to buy, sell, auction and trade NFTs. Use the pre-loaded filters on Wire or upgrade to the premium filters created by our partnerships with the hottest digital artists in the industry. Choose between Private, Public and Retail albums to easily access your NFT for its intended audiences. Personal NFT photos and documents stored in the private setting are viewed only with the owner's permission. The public settings allow friends and family to view your NFTs and can follow your exciting adventures taken with our NFT camera in the marketplace. When set to retail, you can engage with the NFT Marketplace to monetize your unique, high-quality, valuable NFTs. Your NFTs are safe and secure in a decentralized storage environment, forever on the blockchain.

Wire Marketplace has made the process of minting, storing, selling and trading NFTs simple, fast, easy and very low cost. The site is easy to navigate through and set up. It runs on a layer of the Ethereum blockchain and has a list of users on-site to auction, trade, or sell NFTs. You can set up a collection of your own NFT art or post them in a group with other users that authorize you to manage your work with theirs. 

The NFT Marketplace itself is multichain. Wireâ€™s breakthrough protocol UPAP provides universal interoperability for all NFTs to be hosted on the NFT marketplace. MultiChain takes place when two blockchain nodes connect. The identity of each node represents itself with an address with a list of permissions. Therefore, each node it represents sends a message to the other users. The peer-2-peer (P2P) connection aborts if they do not receive any satisfying results from the process. Users in the Wire Market can connect with other blockchains separate from Ethereum for transactions to carry out with ease between different blockchains. 

The marketplace brings some unique new features to the NFT community. Not only can you mint, buy and sell NFTs, but now you can feature and trade your collection of NFTs with other users in the marketplace. You can request a trade swap of your NFT listed with another user's NFT. Also, with the ability to store and display your collection of NFTs, other users can request a trade swap of one of their NFTs for one you have on display. Wire's marketplace is the first to bring the ability to list, request, accept and deny a trade of your NFTs for another NFT displayed on the market.

Royalties are something that every artist is entitled to receive. On the Wire Marketplace, you can set a certain percentage of royalties you collect each time your NFT gets sold. Blockchain has made tracing the timeline of the NFT transactions efficient and ensures a record is kept for royalty disbursement until you decide to stop collecting them.

Many crypto companies distribute free coins to their communities to increase their project's visibility, increase the circulating supply and stimulate trade. These free distributions are commonly known as airdrops. Listed are some of the ways Wire is revolutionizing airdrops.

1. Through Wire, social media marketing piggybacks on current social media ad platforms. Wire can use platforms or operate without them to target and reward new potential crypto users.

2. Wire token recipients undergo KYC/AML, allowing airdrop distributors to target specific user wallets, avoiding regulatory concerns. Completing the KYC/AML process lets you can capitalize on multiple airdrop rewards. Doing this also will give distributors access to the pre-verified and White-Listed users they may not have been able to reach before.

3. As Wire continues to optimize airdropping, projects will be able to track the effectiveness of each airdrop. A company can leverage the data collected in airdrops more precisely to target future users. Projects will be able to target optimal users, providing further awareness. By extracting data from exchanges and social media, airdrops are personalized.
