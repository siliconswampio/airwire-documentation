# Consensus 

The Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism pioneered by EOS, while efficient, ties voting power to token ownership, which can lead to a disparity where those with substantial holdings wield disproportionate influence. This potentially plutocratic governance structure introduces a security risk, as it could allow a small group to control the network, leading to decisions that may not reflect the wider community's best interests. Thus, there is a pressing need for a novel solution that ensures fair representation, reduces the risk of centralization, and enhances the democratic governance of blockchain networks like EOS.

## Appointed Proof of Stake Model

The Wire Network invented Appointed Proof of Stake (APoS) to address the challenges associated with Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms, refining governance and consensus by distinguishing node owners from node operators and implementing a tiered node structure with distinct roles and responsibilities. With strict rules for node compliance and a fail-safe for non-compliant operators, a unique tier-based voting system, and a holistic tokenomics model, Wire Network presents a forward-thinking solution designed to enhance security, fairness, and democratic participation within the blockchain network. This pioneering approach promises to balance scalability with security, setting the stage for an efficient, robust, and sustainable blockchain ecosystem.

Unlike traditional consensus models, APoS necessitates that T1 node owners gain recognition and appointment from fellow T1 node owners to participate in decision-making processes. This algorithm enables T1 node owners to elect block producers through a recurrent approval voting mechanism. The APoS model exhibits a stringent temporal structure. Each block is produced every 500 milliseconds, with a single producer permitted to create a block within a given time slot. Any failure in block production within the designated time frame results in a skipped slot. Wire Network's block production operates in rounds of 252 (equivalent to 12 blocks for each of the 21 producers).

## Node Tiers

The Wire Network operates via a tiered node structure, facilitating distinct roles and responsibilities for different types of node operators. This hierarchical arrangement, along with the economic incentives from the Wire token and the allocation of system resources, helps maintain the robustness, security, and decentralization of the network.

**Tier 1: Senators**  
Tier 1 Nodes (or T1 nodes), with a limited number of 21 seats, are the backbone of the network, entrusted with maintaining consensus and verifying transactions. Each T1 node stakes 7.5 million WIRE, rewarded back over 12 months, and shares 4% of the existing inventory of network resources. T1 node owners enjoy privileged access to future nodes in Wire Node Expansion (see Section 5.2).

**Tier 2: Members of Parliament**  
Tier 2 Nodes (T2 nodes) hold an equal share of 0.15% of the existing inventory. Each T2 node stakes 1 million WIRE, rewarded back over 24 months. T2 nodes, with 84 seats initially, can whitelist contracts using $PWR and $INV.

**Tier 3: Council Members**  
Tier 3 Nodes (or T3 nodes), numbering 1,000 seats at launch, stake 100,000 WIRE rewarded back over 36 months. Each T3 node holds an equal share of 0.00045% of the existing inventory. T1 and T2 nodes are the only ones that can power smart contracts, whereas T3 nodes can simply use their own resources given to their account.

**Auxiliary Tiers**  
Wire Network has four additional tiers (T4, T5, T6, and T7) that each have their own role in the network. For example, T5 funds Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs) and rewards a yield to backers that stake. See section 4.3 for more on WIPs.
