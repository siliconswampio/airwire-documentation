# Consensus 

The Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism pioneered by EOS, while efficient, ties voting power to token ownership, which can lead to a disparity where those with substantial holdings wield disproportionate influence. This potentially plutocratic governance structure introduces a security risk, as it could allow a small group to control the network, leading to decisions that may not reflect the wider community's best interests. Thus, there is a pressing need for a novel solution that ensures fair representation, reduces the risk of centralization, and enhances the democratic governance of blockchain networks like EOS.
