# Governance

The Wire Network employs a democratic process in its governance, ensuring a fair and transparent system that can adapt to the needs and demands of its users. 

## Council Elections

The governance of the Wire Network is managed by a council elected through a multi-step process. This council is tasked with reviewing and voting on Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs). The election process is as follows:

### Submission to the Candidate Pool
Candidates for the council can be nominated by Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 nodes, and they can nominate either themselves or another person. Each candidate must provide a Wire username, verify their Twitter account, provide other necessary KYC data, and submit either a video or a written statement explaining their motivations for wanting to join the council.

### Candidate Submission
Tier 1 nodes submit a preferred list of three candidates, ranked in order of preference: Gold, Silver, and Bronze. All Tier 1 nodes then vote on these submissions, with a 2/3 + 1 majority needed for a submission to pass.

### Voting
The voting process is structured in a circular manner, spanning three rounds - Gold, Silver, and Bronze. In each round, each Tier 1 node casts a vote on each candidate. The votes are cast in phases, with each phase representing a vote on a candidate. If a candidate secures a majority in a round, they are selected, and the Tier 1 node's participation in the voting ends. If none of a Tier 1 node's candidates pass the first three rounds, a Tier 2 node is randomly selected from the pool and put through the voting process.

### Acceptance
Each selected candidate must accept their nomination through an ETH signature upon receiving a majority vote to officially join the council.

## Proposed Instruction Sets
Instruction sets form the core of the Wire Network's operation. These sets, also known as Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), provide a precise definition of all the operations that a computer or device must support. Each instruction is represented by a sequence of bits and is divided into fields corresponding to the constituent elements of the instruction.

## Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs)
WIPs are design documents providing information to the Wire community or describing new features for Wire or its processes. WIPs serve as the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input, and documenting design decisions that have shaped Wire.

A WIP must provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The WIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. For Wire implementers, WIPs provide a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation.

The lifecycle of a WIP is as follows: Create > Draft > Last Call > Accepted > Final. The submission process involves reviewing the WIP structure, forking the WIP repository, adding the WIP to the fork of the repository using a provided template, and finally, submitting a Pull Request to Wire's WIP repository.

A WIP must include a preamble, a simple summary, an abstract, specification, rationale, information on backward compatibility, test cases, and implementations. Including the motivation behind the proposal is not required but highly encouraged.
