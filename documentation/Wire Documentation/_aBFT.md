# Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance

aBFT is a property of Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms. They allow (guaranteed) for honest nodes of a network to agree on the timing and order of a set of transactions fairly and securely. Regardless as to whether there are some nodes maliciously trying to prevent that consensus — even if as many as 1/3 of the nodes are trying to negatively affect consensus by delaying transactions or otherwise corrupting things. This is the ‘fault tolerance’ of the network, i.e. how many nodes can the network tolerate acting maliciously and still come to an honest consensus.
