Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in each tool. Plugins published by block.one are available in the standard binaries installation. 

There are currently two EOSIO components which use plugins:

* [Nodeos Plugins.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/plugins/index) - Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in [Nodeos](../../glossary/index#nodeos). Some plugins are mandatory, such as chain_plugin, net_plugin, and producer_plugin, which reflect the modular design of nodeos. The other plugins are optional as they provide nice to have features, but non-essential for the nodes operation. Follow this link [Nodeos Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/plugins/index) for more information.
* [Keosd Plugins.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/keosd/plugins/index) Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in [Keosd](../../glossary/index#keosd). Follow this link [Keosd Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/keosd/plugins/index) for more information. 

## Community plugins

To use additional community plugins requires you to recompile the binaries linked to the appropriate plugin see [Community Plugin List](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/plugins/COMMUNITY.md) for more information.
