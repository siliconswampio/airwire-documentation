### Installing Nodeos, Cleos and Keosd
The installation process will install `nodeos`, `cleos`, and `keosd`, the components required to run and interact with a blockchain. 

* [Nodeos](../../glossary/index#nodeos) is the core daemon and can be configured to be a [block producer](../../glossary/index#block-producer)  
* [Cleos](../../glossary/index#cleos) is the command line interface used to interact with [Nodeos.](../../glossary/index#nodeos)
* [Keosd](../../glossary/index#keosd) securely stores private keys and is used by [Cleos.](../../glossary/index#cleos)
