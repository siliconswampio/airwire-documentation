# Build ALAIO from Source

> Building ALAIO is for Advanced Developers: If you are new to ALAIO, it is recommended that you install the [ALAIO Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

ALAIO can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build ALAIO using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

> ALAIO Installation Recommended: After building ALAIO successfully, it is highly recommended to install the ALAIO binaries from their default build directory. This copies the ALAIO binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/alaio/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the ALAIO release version.
