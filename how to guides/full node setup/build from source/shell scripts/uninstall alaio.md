# Uninstall ALAIO
---

If you have previously built ALAIO from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `alaio_uninstall.sh` script within the `ala/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/alaio/ala
sudo ./scripts/alaio_uninstall.sh
```

> Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall ALAIO dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt ALAIO binaries or building ALAIO for the first time.
